The 58mm MHW-3Bomber cyclone WDT tool, also fits, and the wooden handled Gaggia classic tamper also fits (although you can get Lelit 57mm tampers.But 57mm will mean that there's less third party accessory choice, vs 58mm, including stuff like upgraded baskets, puck screens and so on.One Heck of a Machine for ¬£450!Other than the 57mm portafilter snag, this really is a lot of machine for the money.You have a huge range of brew temperature options, in 1C increments, and also a really nice range of steam temp options.This means if you want a slower steady steam power while you're learning, you can just leave it at the default 125C, but if you're a seasoned home barista, you can just knock it on full tilt to 140C, for maximum steam power.If you pair this with a decent grinder, for example Lelit Fred, Baratza Encore ESP, DF40+, or better still, Eureka Mignon Libra, Eureka Mignon Zero, DF54, DF64 etc., you're in for some flipping good espresso with this machine, with very little faff.It's not all perfect, it's not likely to be for this price, but other than the 57mm portafilter, there's really no deal breakers for me.If I'm nit-picking, I think the water tank could be more transparent, which would make the cut-out on the side work better for being able to see the water level, and the water tank would benefit from a handle, like the tanks in the Lelit Mara X and Bianca V3.Also the water tank would benefit from a handle, it's a bit faffy to put the tank back in the machine as there's no way to hold the water tank as you're dropping it into the frame, without putting your fingers actually inside the water tank.But for a machine with a 250ml brass boiler and brass group, and great steam power, and big range of brew temp and steam temp adjustments, for about ¬£450, I think this would be very high on my shortlist if I was looking for a sub ¬£500 espresso machine.Re the OPV adjustment, by the way, it's actually very simple to do - I do wish more brands would take the lead of the likes of Profitec and La Marzocco, and put the OPV adjustment on the outside, but it's only a case of taking the lid off, pulling off the water pipe, and adjusting a screw, even I could do that.For loads more options, see:The Best Home Barista Espresso Machine Setups",2024-12-10T19:16:36+00:00,2024-12-10T18:42:29+00:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,Lelit,,Coffee Machines
14887062077821,DeLonghi Magnifica Plus Bean to Cup Coffee Machine,delonghi-magnifica-plus-bean-to-cup-coffee-machine,"The DeLonghi Magnifica Plus is the latest in DeLonghi's Magnifica range, and this may just be my favourite one touch bean to cup machine from DeLonghi so far, and - maybe my favourite one touch bean to cup machine, full stop!Why? Because it's a one touch bean to cup machine capable of HOT milk drinks, hotter than any one touch machine I've used in the past, and its also capable of bold espresso made with up to 17g doses.So what this means, is this is a one touch bean to cup machine capable of proper (and hot) flat whites!The Magnifica Plus impressed me as soon as I saw that it had the same great interface as the Eletta Explore and the Rivelia, as this is a touch screen interface that just works.Features and Benefits1.8L front accessed water tank250g bean hopper6 one touch coffeesStrong espresso (doses up to 17g)Hot milk frothing (about 65C)13 grind settings1450 Watt¬†thermoblock heaterOne touch carafe frotherMax cup height: 14cmGrinder bypass chuteIt's not an overly flashy or complex interface, it's just really easy to use, it even has really handy ""black coffees"" and ""Milk coffees"" shortcuts on the screen so you can narrow down the choices depending on whether you want to make a milk drink or a black coffee.But when I started using it, it became apparent that the Magnifica Plus is impressive in many ways, that I wasn't expecting, to be honest.I'd usually warn people, when going for a pricier DeLonghi machine, that you're not really getting any enhanced performance by going further up the range, as they usually use the same components, so you're just paying for bells & whistles - this definitely isn't the case with the Magnifica plus.DeLonghi are really impressing me lately with their automatic bean to cup machines, as they're actually giving some of their latest machines some really interesting and different features.The Rivelia, for example, has the dual hoppers with switch mode, making it probably the best automatic bean to cup coffee machine for switching from full caff to decaf coffee beans.The Eletta Explore comes with a cold ""lattecrema"" system as well as hot (you can buy this as an optional add on for the Rivelia) and it has a higher quality look and feel to other DeLonghi machines (made in Italy).The Magnifica Plus, though, is one of Delonghi's cheapest machines, and it's one of their best in various areas.Being able to dose up to about 17g in an automatic brewing unit coffee machine, is rare, there aren't many others that will do this, in fact this beats most other DeLonghi bean to cup machines, where max dose weight (and therefore max intensity) is concerned.The lattecrema (milk carafe frother) is just as good as the Eletta explore and the Rivelia, where texture is concerned, and this is very, very good, definitely one of the best for milk texture from a one touch automatic coffee machine.It'll even produce good enough texture for Latte art, it's proper silky micro foam, not the old school 90s cappuccino foam that you'll get from a lot of one touch milk carafes.But what really surprised me about the Magnifica plus was the milk temperature, I've never had milk drinks this hot from a one touch machine.OK some people who like cappuccino and latte at the temperature of the earth's core might not be impressed, but at around 65C, this is the best machine of this kind that I've come across for milk temp, and that's the perfect temperature for milk drinks in my opinion.If you want hotter than this you'd need to go for a machine with a manual steam wand, but I think a lot of people will be really happy with the temperature of their milk drinks on the Magnifica plus.Also thanks to the milk texture, and the intense espresso it'll produce, this relatively inexpensive bean to cup machine will deliver a pretty impressive flat white!And when I say ""pretty impressive"", for a one touch bean to cup machine, that translates to epic, as bean to cup machines don't really do flat white, usually, they do a small latte that is labelled as flat white on the menu for marketing purposes.But this is one of the very few one touch machines that actually deserves to have ""flat white"" on the menu, in my humble opinion.",2024-12-09T18:58:55+00:00,2024-12-09T13:13:47+00:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,De'Longhi,,Coffee Machines

They're a huge brand, they target the mainstream home appliance market so they need to keep their prices competitive, but they don't do it in ways that tend to compromise the longevity or durability of their machines.So, yeah, they're mainly plastic (especially their lowest price machines), they're ""no frills"", they usually have pressurised baskets, or pressurisation in the portafilter (you can get around this, if you want to), but they're also usually the most capable for their cost, and they usually last well.| titlestrongFeatures and Benefits|showbullet 1 L Water Tank |showbullet Compact size,21cm w x 34 cm d x 26 cm t|showbullet 150ml Stainless Steel Brew Boiler |showbullet Pro Steam Wand (Panarello version also available¬† ¬†|showbullet Comes in a range of different colours |showbullet 51mm portafilter - pressurised |In a nutshell, this is a portafilter espresso machine with a 150ml stainless steel boiler, and a proper steam wand, for under a hundred quid!Just to put that into perspective, the Gaggia Classic Pro E24, even with the new higher capacity boiler (just because of the reduced thickness of the boiler material, being brass instead of the previously used Aluminium) has a slightly smaller boiler (now just under 130ml).This isn't to say size is everything, but it's impressive that such a cheap espresso machine, from such a well known brand which is known for making machines that last, has a stainless steel 150ml boiler.It has a manual shot dial similar to the Sage Duo Temp Pro, so ultra simple controls, not much electronics to go wrong, and it has a 51mm portafilter with a pressurised basket.If you want to use pre-ground coffee or grind your own commodity beans (meaning big brand coffee beans with no roasted on date) then just use the supplied portafilter.If you want to use freshly roasted coffee beans, and the ability to dial in, you'll just want to swap out the portafilter and the basket.Most of the options when it comes to 51mm 2 eared portafilters that fit the Stilosa, will be bottomless, for example theNormcore bottomless portafilteris popular, as is thewooden handled 51mm portafilter from Ikape.Just keep in mind that bottomless portafilters look great when you're dialled in, and they increase max cup height, plus they can give you some visual clues about what's happening with the extraction.The issue though, with bottomless portafilters, is they're messy, until you're dialled in. You'll get what are known as spurters, which is espresso spraying from the basket at all angles, and it's messy and annoying.If you have a capable grinder, though, and you can get well dialled in, once you've done that, bottomless portafilters are great.If you want a spouted option, there aren't many, due to the popularity of bottomless portafilters I assume, but have a look at this51mm spouted 2 eared portafilter, which is compatible with the Stilosa.You will find many people recommending switching the basket to an IMS or VST precision basket, and I'd say that's fine as long as you have a decent, capable grinder.Most sub ¬£300 espresso grinders (I'm referring here to electric grinders, not manual) aren't quite up to the task of grinding fine enough with precision baskets, or high extraction baskets.The stock basket that will come with the above suggestions, should be plenty high quality enough for using with other, more entry level grinders paired with the Stilosa.",2024-12-09T09:59:52+00:00,2024-06-19T11:36:10+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,De'Longhi,,Coffee Machines

It's feature packed, it has loads of one touch coffees, 3 user profiles, a touch screen display and a smartphone app.It's probably the most capable machines from DeLonghi overall, and it's definitely one of the best of their machines in terms of look and feel.So this is DeLonghi's flagship machine, and it's definitely one of their best overall, but the only thing I would say is that some of their newer machines (the Rivelia and the Eletta Explore) have a lot of the same features.Features and Benefits18 One Touch Coffees: Espresso, coffee, long, doppio+, coffee pot, Americano, cappuccino, latte macchiato, cappuccino mix, caffe latte, flat white, cortado, espresso macchiatoOne Touch Milk Carafe12 Grind SettingsWater Tank (front accessed): 2.2 LMax Cup Height: 14 cmDimensions (WxDxH): 26.2 x 48.5 x 39 cmThe Rivelia doesn't quite have the same premium look & feel as the Primadonna Soul, the Eletta Explore though, for me, comes very close to this in terms of the premium build quality and the features.So if I were looking at this, I'd also be looking at the Eletta Explore, and asking myself what I'd be gaining, exactly, for the additional cost, as for me that's not entirely clear.The app is pretty good, it works well as the interface for the bean adapt feature, which is De'Longhi's answer to barista assistance.Bean adapt isn't a bad feature, it's not really ""dialling in"" as such, but it's something, it does help the user to attempt to get more satisfactory results with each bean, and it's very simple to use.Like most coffee machine apps, it's not really all that useful, and I think a lot of people will find that they probably don't use it much, if at all, once the novelty wears off.It can't take a cup out of the cupboard and put it on the drip tray for you, and yes you can wake it up from the app, but then it'll do a rinse of the group, so if you leave a cup on the drip tray and then order a coffee from your bed, your first coffee of the day will include some slightly rank rinse water.I do think the price point of this machine vs the features compared to some of DeLonghi's cheaper machines including the Dinamica and particularly the Eletta Explore, is a bit too far into the point of diminishing returns.Having said that, if you can grab this while it's on offer, it's a sturdy, well built machine so you should find it lasts long enough to make it great long term value for money, and it'll make pretty decent coffee considering it's a fully automatic bean to cup machine.For more information on Delonghi coffee machines see:The Best Delonghi Coffee Machines Review",2024-10-11T10:07:48+01:00,2024-06-18T12:45:58+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,Sage,,Coffee Machines

One one hand bottomless portafilters are good training tools from that perspective, but then I can't help but ask the question, if you couldn't taste it in the cup, who cares? ;-).Anyway, they are cool, there's really something special about using bottomless portafilters, again - once you're dialled in, before that it's generally messy, so you may want to lift your cup/glass right up to cover the bottom of the basket until this is the case, to safe your kitchen becoming espresso coloured.IKAPE, which I'm told (by the brand themselves) is pronounced ""I Capey"", or just ""IK"" for short, is a Chinese coffee gear brand. Their products generally not the cheapest, but not the most expensive either.For me their products tend to be in that sweet spot in terms of being good value without going too far over to beyond the point of diminishing returns, and they've been one of the mostprolific brands of coffee gear over the past few years, especially when it comes to espresso accessories.They do a number of bottomless portafilters for the 54mm Sage machines, and they'll all work fine.The only thing I could say as a negative for these, and various other aftermarket portafilters are that the you can very easily unscrew the handle, which does annoy me slightly.Sometimes it'll come unscrewed as you're using it, so if I was using one of these and I didn't have any plans to swap the handle (their handles are interchangeable), I'd just add some loctite to the thread.Sage do sell a bottomless portafilter for their 58mm machines, but not for the 54mm machines, by the way, so if you want to use a bottomless you'll need an aftermarket one.",2024-10-09T18:01:18+01:00,2024-08-19T12:47:47+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,The Coffeeworks,,Coffee Accessories

It's an automatic bean to cup machine at the very entry level, one of the lowest priced machines in their range.If you're wondering how it's different from the Magnifica S (which has been around for quite a bit longer and can often be bagged for a lower price), it's mainly down to the more modern interface, and having Americano on the one touch menu.So the first thing to explain, given that DeLonghi and other brands have now followed various retailers in misusing the term ""bean to cup machine"", is that this is what we now have to refer to as an ""automatic"" bean to cup machine, to differentiate from what DeLonghi and other brands refer to as just ""bean to cup"" machines. More on this shortly.The ""Automatic"" bit refers to the fact that the coffee is produced automatically, all you have to do is make sure there is water in the tank and beans in the hopper.Features and BenefitsPanarello Steam Wand3 Pre-set Coffees (Espresso, Coffee, Americano)1.8 Litre Water Tank13 Grind SettingsDreg Drawer Capacity: 14 CoffeesMax cup height: 14cmDimensions (WxDxH): 24 x 44 x 35 cmGoing back to the ""bean to cup"" thing, Saeco coined this phrase when they invented the first ""bean to cup coffee machine"", in the 80s.The presence of a brewing unit to replace the portafilter and the associated barista workflow, in addition to the integrated grinder, meant that it was literally ""from bean, to cup"", which is where the term came from.These days, ""bean to cup"" is being used to describe any coffee machine with a built in grinder, which is one of my pet peeves, but anyway, it is what it is - I'm having to remember these days to add ""Auto"" to ""bean to cup"" when I'm referring to ""true"" bean to cup machines, not the end of the world I suppose ;-).So as I've said, coffee (espresso, coffee, Americano) is automatic, you just press a button.The milk frothing isn't automatic, it has a steam wand, what's referred to as a ""Panarello"" wand, for reasons no one appears to know, by the way, Panarello is an Italian surname so I'm guessing it was the surname of the person who first invented this kind of milk Frother, maybe?Anyway, this is just a sheath fitted over the steam pipe with an air intake which drags air into the milk with the steam, creating the froth.It works well, for big bubbled ""old school"" milk foam, but not so much for more modern micro foam, for velvety flat whites. The S Smart comes with the very clever 2 settings panarello which gives you control over the aeration, and allows the creation of micro foam texture.I don't know why they don't put this steam wand on all their machines to be honest, it's the best panarello wand I've ever used. So, if you want that kind of control, you may want to look at the S smart.If you're looking for a ""one touch cappuccino"" type machine, you may want to look at the Rivelia, or the Eletta Explore.If you're mainly looking for Americano, coffee & espresso though, and maybe the odd cappuccino but you're really not fussed about this ""micro foam"" nonsense ;-), then this machine might be perfect for you.It's one of the cheapest of this type, all the machines in the Magnifica range tend to produce very similar tasting coffee (they're more or less the same internally, so that would make sense) and it's just slightly more modern than the S and S Smart when it comes to the user interface.If you're wondering what ""coffee"" means, vs espresso and Americano, by the way, this means ""caffe creme"", basicaly a bigger ratio espresso.If you're someone who really knows their caffe creme and you're about to argue with me about that, by the way, there's no need ;-).I agree that this isn't traditionally what caffe creme is at all - but this is more or less what this setting is on most bean to cup coffee machines, a bigger ratio espresso, and I think cafe creme is the best description for what ""coffee"" means on a machine like this.If you want to experience the closest to true espresso when you're choosing espresso on a bean to cup machine like this, and the closest to traditional caffe creme when choosing ""coffee"", I'd recommend adjusting your grinder towards the finest end of the range for espresso, and towards the more coarse end for ""coffee"".",2024-10-08T18:44:16+01:00,2024-06-18T12:11:13+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,De'Longhi,,Coffee Machines

It's not perfect, there are pros and cons, but this does have a couple of very specific features that a lot of the other leading competitors don'tNamely, the flow control with the ability to steep and release, and the removable water tank.The removable water tank is the one thing that I much prefer about the the Wilfa Svart performance vs both the Sage Precision Brewer and the Moccamaster brewers.It's also very simple to use, there's recommendations for how much coffee to use for each water level, a little thing but very useful for people who're new to filter brewing - and other than this, there's just an on/off button and the flow restrictor at the bottom of the filter holder.This isn't as clever as the precision brewer when it comes to all of the variable settings, but if you're just wanting a really simple to use brewer that you don't need to think much about, which is quiet, good looking, and gives you the ability to control the flow, I think this is a good choice.It has a hot plate, and a glass carafe, and this is something that tends to divide people.Personally I do prefer a thermal carafe without a hot plate, but I do accept that, especially if you're not making a full carafe of coffee, you do need to make sure the carafe is pre-heated so it doesn't act as a heatsink.Some people just prefer a glass carafe and a heat plate, so if that's you, you'll probably be even more inclined to go for this brewer.As with the Sage precision brewer, it will make use of all of the water you put in the tank, so you don't have water constantly sitting in the tank, but unlike the precision brewer, you can remove the tank to fill it and to rinse it out, which I do think is a good choice.",2024-07-29T18:49:45+01:00,2024-06-28T15:45:56+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,Amazon,,Coffee Machines

When you put it to cappuccino, the air intakes are open, when you put it to hot milk, they're closed.So what this means is you can control the stiffness of your foam buy how long you leave it with the air intake open before switching¬† it to closed. Once you find what works for you, you'll be consistently creating the kind of milk texture you want for your milkies.If you're buying a machine to enter the home barista hobby, then you'll probably want to go for the Arte' version, and then get a third party unpressurised portafilter, and/or a bottomless portafilter, a replacement shower screen & so on.The Delonghi Dedica ReviewThey're really sturdy little machines too for the money, honestly if you're¬† looking for a low cost machine, you can do far worse than the Delonghi Dedica, and yeah you can do far better too, for far more money.For a detailed review on the Dedica Arte, Style and Maestro watch this video:",2024-06-20T17:49:24+01:00,2024-06-19T13:37:13+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,De'Longhi,,Coffee Machines
8722669469933,Breville One Touch Espresso Machine.,breville-one-touch-espresso-machine,"I have to admit, when I discovered how many people are buying the Breville one touch coffee house, I nearly spat my coffee out.This is one of the best selling coffee machines in the UK at the moment, and honestly, that amazes me, and I think it's proof that the UK is a long, long way behind other countries (especially Australia & New Zealand) where coffee is concerned.Would I want to own this machine, oh heck no. I wouldn't even want to use it as a door stop. Does this mean you shouldn't, though? Not necessarily, you might love it, and I'll explain why.So the bottom line here is that this is very much a machine for ""normal"" coffee drinkers. If you even have a mild interest in speciality coffee and the home barista hobby, then this isn't for you.It's also not a one touch machine, technically speaking - but it's MUCH cheaper than one touch bean to cup coffee machines, and it makes much hotter milk drinks than most.So if you were looking for a one touch cappuccino/latte maker, and you like very hot latte or cappuccino, and you don't want to spend the roughly ¬£600-¬£700 or more that it usually costs to buy a one touch machine, you might love this machine, as many people do.| titlestrongFeatures and Benefits|showbullet 1.4 L Water Tank |showbullet Auto Frothing Milk Carafe |showbullet Maximum Cup Height 10cm |showbullet 22cm Wide 27cm Deep and 32cm Tall |So let's start off with this ""One Touch"" thing first.They're calling it the one touch, I assume because it has a one touch milk carafe, that is, the same kind of auto milk frothing carafe that one touch machines have.But what really makes one touch machines one touch, that they have integrated grinders, internal brewing units, and a user interface that allows the user to just select whatever drink they want and have the machine do the rest.This isn't a one touch machine by any sense of the word. It's basically a low cost, traditional pump espresso machine with a portafilter, with a milk carafe attached that you'd usually find on a one touch bean to cup machine.You have to dose the basket in the portafilter with pre-ground coffee (or grind your own), give it a light tamp, insert it into the group, and even then, there's more than one touch of the buttons required to make your cappuccino or latte - if you're making a large latte for example, that requires two touches.The milk texture is OK, it's very standard one touch milk carafe texture, nothing to write home about, but it does the job and most ""normal"" coffee drinkers I think will be more than happy with it.If you're one of the many people in the UK who likes scalding hot milkies, then you'll probably really like this machine, even though this is one of the things I really can't stand about this machine.I don't like my milkies made with burnt milk, and I can tell the difference in the cup if I take the milk a bit too hot, it just dulls the flavour down, taking away some of the sweetness that the milk or milk alternative brings.But if you're someone who likes very hot cappuccino or latte and you like to add sugar or syrup, then you'll be replacing the lost sweetness.I measured the milk temperature, and most of the time it was up to about 75C, which for me is 10-15C too hot. If you would usually ask for an extra hot cappuccino or latte when ordering from a cafe, though, then you'll probably be really happy with this temperature.So, if you want a cheap (it may not seem cheap, but it's about a quarter of the price of even entry level one touch bean to cup coffee machines) machine that is simple to use, and isn't ""one touch"" but is relatively quick and easy to use once you know what you're doing, and that will make really hot cappuccino and latte, this might be the machine for you.For details of espresso machines under ¬£500 click the link below:The Best Cheap Espresso Machines",2024-06-20T13:38:07+01:00,2024-06-20T13:28:15+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,Sage,,Coffee Machines
8683990122733,DeLonghi Rivelia Bean To Cup Coffee Machine,delonghi-rivelia-bean-to-cup-coffee-machine,"The DeLonghi Rivelia is DeLonghi's latest bean to cup coffee machine, and on paper Iwas intrigued. Was I expecting this to be the best bean to cup machine I've ever used, haha, nah - but guess what?I think it might just be!It's been a long time since I've been able to say this, but DeLonghi have impressed me, a LOT.If you've never been here before, you may misunderstand this to be the same exaggerated sales blurb you'll read whenever you're thinking about buying anything.If you have read my content before, you'll know this isn't the case. I write ""warts 'n all"" reviews.As you'll read below, the Rivelia isn't perfect, there are a couple of things I'd change, but they're insignificant, while the things that have surprised me about this machine, are really quite significant!Anyone who has read enough of my content will know that although I very much appreciate bean to cup machines for how easy they are to use, they're not quite for me.I'm talking aboutactualbean to cup machines here, by the way, not machines from Sage such as the Barista Express & Barista Pro, which are often sold as bean to cup coffee machines.Bean to cup machines (which have built in grinders and internal brewing units or ""infusers"") are usually a bit of a much of a muchness until you get to the very high end, approaching commercial bean to cup machine territory.For example, the Bravilor Sprso, Gaggia Accademia & DeLonghi Maestosa are all close to the two grand mark, and they do deliver something different where cup quality is concerned.But most other entry to mid level bean to cup coffee machines, tend to have very similar tech, and deliver incredibly similar cup quality.This, however, is a mid priced bean to cup machine from DeLonghi, which I have to say, I think blows most of the similarly price one touch milk machines out of the water!| titlestrongFeatures and Benefits|showbullet12 One Touch Hot Coffees|showbullet 9 One Touch Iced Coffees (via optional addon)|showbullet True micro foam (from a one touch milk carafe!)|showbulletQuick Swap Hoppers|showbulletBean Adapt - Dialing In Assistance|showbulletVery Intuitive, Interactive User Interface|showbullet1.4 Litre Water Tank¬† (front accessed)showbulletDump Box Capacity: 10|showbulletExtra Shot Function|showbulletMaximum Cup Height : 14.0|showbulletGrinder Bypass Chute for Pre-ground|The Rivelia is quite a revelation, which does sound like a pun, but it's not really since Rivelia is Italian for ""Reveal"", so that doesn't quite work.It has a dual hopper system for loading different beans & a clever ""switch"" mode for allowing you to make one last coffee with the beans that have already dropped into the burrs when you swap over.The user interface is refreshingly simple, and talks to the user as if it's human, right from the point that you turn it on, for example instead of just prompting you to enter the date, it displays this text on the touch screen:""Before we go any further, can you tell me what time it is? It'll only take a minute.""And below that is the option to choose the day and the time.The more I went through the set up steps, the more impressed I became with it, but then, I tasted the espresso...It was up there with the best espresso I've had from a bean to cup machine.OK, impressive. But then I made a ""flat white"", and I'm using the quote marks because remember, this is a one touch milk forther bean to cup machine, they can't do proper flat white texture.The Rivelia, actually can!I can honestly say, this was the best flat white I've ever had from a one touch milk carafe bean to cup coffee machine.Obviously the machine won't do the latte art ;-), if you want do do that you need to let the milk froth into a jug and then pour it into your espresso, but this kind of milk texture from a one touch bean to cup machine is unheard of.Well, maybe it's not unheard of in marketing blurb, but in terms of actually being able to produce this kind of texture, this is the first I've seen true microfoam from a one touch milk carafe.You have control of the texture, too. If you prefer a slightly stiffer foam for what I refer to as modern cappuccino, it'll do that too, just by setting the froth dial to the ""creamy"" icon.Bean Adapt TechnologyThis is, essentially, dialling in assistance.There's not a great deal of dialling in to be done with a bean to cup machine, to be fair.Why they've given this kind of technology to a bean to cup machine, while they've given their latest machines aimed at the home barista market, only 8 grind settings and no such helpful dialling in assistance, does make me scratch my head a bit.Nonetheless, this is clever, and very convenient.Basically you tell it what the roast profile of the beans are, you tell it what the grind setting is, and then when you've pulled a shot, it asks you to choose from a few options to tell the machine what you thought of it.You can then save the name of your beans, and it'll tell you what grind size and brew temp to use for these beans when you select that you're using them in future.Its smart, but I think they should really have put this on the La Specialista range, I'm not sure it's quite as useful on their bean to cup machines as it would be with their portafilter machines.Quick Swap Hoppers + Switch ModeThis isveryclever, and I think it's possibly the best approach I've seen from any coffee manufacturer so far when it comes to dealing with different beans.The Melitta TS Smart for example, the only bean to cup coffee machine that doesn't require a mortgage which has at least attempted to resolve this issue, has a split hopper, just one hopper divided in two, feeding the same grinder.Not great, but at least they've tried.The Best Bean to Cup MachinesThere is the DeLonghi Maestosa, which has two hoppers feeding two grinders, that's certainly an approach, but at about two grand, it's a very expensive approach.So what DeLonghi have done here is to give the user two hoppers, with a switch system, which means that when you go to switch the hoppers, you're asked if you want to make one last coffee with the beans that are already sitting on top of the burrs, or if you want to purge the beans instead (waste them).So if you're making a full caffeine coffee for yourself and then a decaf for your better half, for example, you just use the switch option to make one last coffee using the full caffeine beans that are still on top of the burrs when you switch, and then you make the decaf.You can go straight from one hopper and back, for example make yourself a full caffeine coffee in switch mode, then make a decaf also in switch mode, then put your full caffeine hopper back on.The only downside to doing this is that in switch mode you can't control the intensity, you just get whatever was left below the hopper on top of the burrs when you unlock the hopper. Still, amazing feature!Cold Milk FrothingAs well as an iced Americano function for making cooler Americano over ice, it has the ability to produce cold froth, for iced latte, cappuccino, flat white and more!The only downside to this is you need to buy thecool lattecrema system.If you do that, when you put that in place, it automatically opens up a new menu on the touch screen for cold frothed drinks, cold frothed versions all of your hot milkies!Negatives?As I've said, it's not perfect, but the imperfections are fairly insignificant.The only thing that I think might put some people off, is that as with all one touch carafe machines I've used, the milk temperature is limited and you have no control over it.For me, it's perfect. I measured the milk temp as being around 60-62C, and that's bang on in my opinion, but if you're one of the people who enjoy scalding hot milkies, it may be a negative for you, that you're limited to this milk temp.I do wish DeLonghi would make it a bit easier for us to know what intensity relates to (roughly) in terms of grams. I will work this out, and I'll update this accordingly when I have, but I don't know why they don't just tell us ""setting 1 is approx. 5 grams of coffee"" and so on.I wish they gave a bit more control over espresso volume. ""Small"" is about 30-35ml, and I can live with that, but I'd like the ability to be able to choose a smaller volume than that, ideally.If you leave the hot water spout in its designated holder inside the storage compartment on the top, and leave the scoop/brush tool in it's cut-out slot, the lid doesn't shut properly.Not a big deal, you'll probably never use the scoop anyway,¬† you can just lob that in a drawer, but still, they've done such a good job with everything else, it seems like a strange little error to make.There's a little tactile dot on the on/off icon.¬†I can only assume this is to help visually impaired users, otherwise I can't think what it would be for.If this is what it's meant for, that's great, but the only issue with that is that the on/off is so sensitive that as soon as you feel this dot, you've turned it on or off.So if this is the intention, I think they'd need to reduce the sensitivity to allow someone to lightly feel for this tactile reference point. ¬†I do realise that as a touch screen machine this wouldn't help anyone who is blind, but I'd think it would be at least helpful for people with some level of visual impairment.And that's literally all I can find fault with.So, overall, this is without a doubt the best mid priced one touch bean to cup coffee machine I've used, and the milk texture is the best I've experienced from any one touch milk carafe, full stop!",2024-06-10T20:24:58+01:00,2024-05-29T15:59:07+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,Philips,,Coffee Machines

With an E61 group machine, once it's properly pre-heated (20-30 mins) 93C is going to be fine for most people who're using relatively traditional espresso roast profiles.And with a cooler temperature of 91C being available, along with two hotter temperatures of 95 & 98, people who're pulling relatively standard shots of espresso will find this range to be fine.Where the visuals are concerned, they've done a really good job here, it still looks like the Appartamento, but they've managed to give it even more character, especially with the shape of the group, which is triangular instead of the usual rounded style.If you're looking for a head turning espresso machine for relatively traditional shots of espresso, and with enough steam power to quickly steam milk for great quality cappuccino, latte, flat white or whatever floats your boat - and you're looking for a well built Italian machine that will last for decades if well maintained, I think the Appartamento deserves to be on your shortlist.The Best Home Espresso MachinesOne thing that makes the Appartamento TCA particularly appealing in the UK, is that the UK distributor Pro Espresso have created their ""Fuel Club"" plan, which allows you to get it via a subscription, for just ¬£59 per month!.If that sounded too good to be true, check this out - the minimum term is only 3 months, if you don't like it, they'll just come get it.

Personally I think flat bottomed tampers make more sense, but I can't deny the rippled pattern in the puck looks pretty, despite the fact that I'm pretty sure it makes no difference at all to the shot.In theory, there's a slight negative of rippled vs flat, in that a tiny amount of the ground coffee sometimes gets stuck in the grooves.

It's just as good in these areas than any other sub ¬£100 scale I've used, and it's better than some scales in certain areas.In fact, in a couple of areas I'd go so far as to say it's better than the Acaia Lunar. For one, it won't cost you a divorce when the better half finds out how much you spent on scales ;-).The main thing I like about this vs the Lunar though is the physical on/off switch.The Acia Lunar is very good, don't get me wrong, but I do find not having a physical on/off to be a pain at times, turning it off when I'm trying to do something else with it such as change modes or re-set the timer, and turning it on by mistake.Being able to easily (just the position of the on/off slider) turn off the audio is a great feature vs some other scales on the market, and it's great that it has an auto start mode for espresso if you want to use that, and a pourover mode.Personally I prefer to use the standard mode, but if you like to use an auto start, this has worked well when I've used it.It has a USB C charger, 1500 mAh Li-ion, so you shouldn't have to re-charge it often, and it's a really nice, solid set of scales, very good for the money.",2024-05-24T19:57:06+01:00,2024-04-02T14:00:08+01:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,The Coffeeworks,,Coffee Accessories

The see through handle revealing the thick black spring offset with the red and black interior does look great, and it works really well too.Vs other calibrated tampers, the only thing I could say on the negative side is that the focus on the visual side of thing means that it's quite loud, it kind of sounds like a squeaky gate, which is fine I suppose, but I do think this is the only tamper I've ever used that plays a tune ;-).It's just one of its quirks, though, and over all¬† I really like it.Re the flat base, I don't believe that a rippled base actually produces any benefit, other than producing a rippled surface, which is quite cool to look at, but I can't see that it actually does anything.I think there was some thought initially that giving the surface a ripple may help with an even extraction, but I honestly don't think it does, I've certainly never been able to detect any difference from using flat vs rippled tampers.In my opinion, the only real difference is that the rippled surface tampers can sometimes remove a very small amount of coffee from the surface, as some occasionally gets trapped in some of the ripples. I can't see any way this would produce a positive difference, but it's so small that it probably doesn't produce a negative difference either.It's available to fit portafilter sized from 51mm, to 58mm.Ikape do warn that there may be imperfections in the acrylic handle, although in the couple that I've got, there's no imperfections at all, it's like looking through solid glass.So, yeah, this is a very nice looking, very effective calibrated tamper with a flat base, it's a bit squeaky, other than that it's very cool.",2024-04-02T17:38:18+01:00,2024-03-18T13:14:09+00:00,2024-12-11T13:29:07+00:00,The Coffeeworks,,Coffee Accessories
